<h2>How to display variable?</h2>
<div class="php_section"> 
  <p>We can display variable as follows:</p>
  <div style="width:700px;overflow:auto">
  <pre><strong>
&lt;?php

  $var = "String";
  echo "&lt;b&gt;".$var . "&lt;br&gt;";

?&gt;
</pre>
  </div>
</strong>
    where <strong>&dollar;var</strong> is the name of variable.

<h2>Arrays in PHP</h2>
<div class="php_section">
 <p> In PHP, there are three types of arrays:
    
<br><strong>Indexed arrays</strong> - Arrays with a numeric index
<br><strong>Associative arrays</strong>  - Arrays with named keys
<br><strong>Multidimensional arrays</strong> - Arrays containing one or more array

<h3>Loops in PhP</h3>
<section>
   
    <div class = "php_section">
        
        <p>
Often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again a certain number of times. So, instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops.
Loops are used to execute the same block of code again and again, as long as a certain condition is true.
<br>
<br>In PHP, we have the following loop types:
<br><strong>while</strong> - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true.
<br><strong>do...while</strong> - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true.
<br><strong>for</strong> - loops through a block of code a specified number of times.
<br><strong>foreach</strong> - loops through a block of code for each element in an array.
<br>

<section><!--Switch section-->
    <h4>Switch statement in PhP</h4>
    <div class = "php_section">
        <p>
                The switch statement can be used to select on of many blocks of code to be executed.
            <br>
            <br>A single value is evaluated at the start of the switch statement and compared with the values of each case. <strong>Only the case that has a matching value will be executed.</strong>
            <br>The <strong>break</strong> statement is used to prevent the switch loop from running code from case to case. And the <strong>default</strong> statement is used incase there are no matches to our cases.
            <br>Here is some sample syntax:
<div style="width:350px;overflow:auto">
<pre>
    switch (n) {
        case label1:
          code to be executed if n=label1;
          break;
        case label2:
          code to be executed if n=label2;
          break;
        case label3:
          code to be executed if n=label3;
          break;
          ...
        default:
          code to be executed if n is different from all labels;
      }
</pre>
</div>
            <br>And here is an example:
<br>
<div style="width:350px;overflow:auto">
<pre>
    &lt?php
    $favcolor = "red";
    
    switch ($favcolor) {
      case "red":
        echo "Your favorite color is red!";
        break;
      case "blue":
        echo "Your favorite color is blue!";
        break;
      case "green":
        echo "Your favorite color is green!";
        break;
      default:
        echo "Your favorite color is neither red, blue, nor green!";
    }
    ?> 
</pre>
</div>
